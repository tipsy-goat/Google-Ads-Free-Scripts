// ## Why Is This Free?

// These scripts were originally built for **personal use**.
// They solve small, recurring problems I encountered while working with Google Ads accounts, and they’re intentionally:

// - **Simple to implement**
// - **Easy to understand and modify**
// - **Practical for real-world use**, not over-engineered tools

// Publishing them publicly costs me nothing and helps:
// - Brands avoid common pitfalls
// - Agencies save time on repetitive checks
// - Practitioners learn from real, production-used scripts

// There’s no SaaS, no upsell, and no hidden catch — just utilities that might be useful to others facing the same problems.
// If they save you time or prevent a mistake, they’ve done their job.
